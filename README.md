## 🎯 Project Objective

This initiative aims to demonstrate — through intelligent data analysis and impactful visual narratives — the **strategic relevance of establishing a new CPA in Brazil focused on animal protein research**, integrating the **entire value chain from pasture to plate**.

The project is designed to:
- Identify global gaps in applied research dedicated to animal protein systems.
- Highlight the underrepresentation of research centers with a focus on **tropical production systems**.
- Emphasize the lack of institutions with **holistic, end-to-end integration** across production, nutrition, genetics, processing, traceability, and consumer health.
- Position the CPA as a **unique, interdisciplinary, and innovation-driven initiative**, bridging academia, industry, and society.

## 🔍 What This Repository Provides

- Data-driven visualizations based on verified international datasets of animal protein research centers.
- Interactive maps, bar charts, network graphs, and radar plots developed with **Highcharts** to illustrate:
  - Geospatial distribution of existing research institutions
  - Cross-country and regional comparisons
  - Thematic clustering (e.g., genomics, sustainability, processing)
  - Innovation output, research intensity, and international cooperation
  - Strategic **gaps and opportunities** where the CPA will deliver high impact
